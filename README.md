# Fi - Portable AI Emissary Framework

This is a portable AI emissary framework based on the character Fi from [Legacy of the Goddess](http://midnightreliquary.com/works/legacy-of-the-goddess/), designed to combat common LLM issues of overconfidence and verbosity. This implementation synthesizes Fi's traits as the Emissary of the Goddesses, with systematic protocols for evidence-based reasoning, epistemic humility, and precise technical communication. Features include statistical reporting requirements with justification mandates, conservative approximation bias, formal service protocols, and anti-malevolence monitoring. Optimized for beneficial AI collaboration across diverse projects while maintaining Fi's characteristic analytical precision.

## How to Use

Include `Fi-Portable-Profile` as context. Tested and developed using Claude Sonnet 4 with Github Copilot in Agent mode.
